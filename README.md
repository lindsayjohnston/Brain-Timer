# Pomodoro-Timer
Goal: Create a timer that I can use to keep track of learning/working sprints and short brain-friendly breaks using JS.  
Inspired by the Pomodoro Technique: [Read here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

## Further Work Needed:
A way to keep track of breaks.  
A display of total minutes/hours spent on a certain task.  
A display of the ratio of break time/work time.  
And "End of Work Day" stats display.
